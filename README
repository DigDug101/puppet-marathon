Marathon
========

Provides a class to install the Marathon framework for Mesos.
If you want to run Marathon, you'll likely want to look at this module too:
https://forge.puppetlabs.com/deric/mesos

Usage
-----
Note that this is a defined type, not a class. This allows multiple marathon instances to exist on one machine.

include marathon

Support
-------

This module is currently very young and has only been properly tested with CentOS/RHEL7. Contributions are welcome! Please log tickets and issues at our [Projects site](https://github.com/meltwater/puppet-marathon)

Pull Requests are always welcome of course.
